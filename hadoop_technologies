Project Name	Description

Ambari:		An integrated set of Hadoop administration tools for installing, monitoring, and maintaining a Hadoop cluster. Also included are tools to add or remove slave nodes.

Avro:		A framework for the efficient serialization (a kind of transformation) of data into a compact binary format

Flume:		A data flow service for the movement of large volumes of log data into Hadoop

HBase:		A distributed columnar database that uses HDFS for its underlying storage. With HBase, you can store data in extremely large tables with variable column structures.

HCatalog:	A service for providing a relational view of data stored in Hadoop, including a standard approach for tabular data

Hive:		A distributed data warehouse for data that is stored in HDFS; also provides a query language thatâ€™s based on SQL (HiveQL)

Hue:		A Hadoop administration interface with handy GUI tools for browsing files, issuing Hive and Pig queries, and developing Oozie workflows

Mahout:		A library of machine learning statistical algorithms that were implemented in MapReduce and can run natively on Hadoop

Oozie:		A workflow management tool that can handle the scheduling and chaining together of Hadoop applications

Pig:		A platform for the analysis of very large data sets that runs on HDFS and with an infrastructure layer consisting of a compiler that produces sequences of MapReduce programs and a language layer consisting of the query language named Pig Latin

Sqoop:		A tool for efficiently moving large amounts of data between relational databases and HDFS

ZooKeeper:	A simple interface to the centralized coordination of services (such as naming, configuration, and synchronization) used by distributed applications
