some time you might get error while pushing, as following:

abort: push creates new remote head <someRevisionNumber>!
(did you forget to merge? use push -f to force)


If so:

we should not use, -f . This will break the repo.

If you have the "rebase" extension enabled, you can fix this with "hg pull --rebase".  

However you probably don't have that enabled, so run the following to do a merge:

hg pull
hg merge
hg commit -u <userName> -m "Merged"
hg push
